The submission consists of the corresponding files:
1) main.py - python code for extracting features based on the pretrained MXNet.
2) MXnet.zip - pretrained weights of MXnet used as external data.
3) picToXlogRes.r - r code for morphological segmentation of a given slice (in all three directions face, profile and head) and features extraction from the segmented mask of a given slice. 
4) prepare_head_logres.r - segmenting of all of the patients from head direction, the slice is then selected with respect to a pretrained logistic regression from paper "Probability of Cancer in Pulmonary Nodules
Detected on First Screening CT" mentioned in the tutorial video
5) prepare_face_logres.r - segmenting of all of the patients from face direction, the slice is then selected with respect to a pretrained logistic regression from paper "Probability of Cancer in Pulmonary Nodules
Detected on First Screening CT" mentioned in the tutorial video
6) prepare_profile_logres.r - segmenting of all of the patients from profile direction, the slice is then selected with respect to a pretrained logistic regression from paper "Probability of Cancer in Pulmonary Nodules
Detected on First Screening CT" mentioned in the tutorial video
7) finalres.r - training posterior model probabilities by MJMCMC algorithm and making predictions as Bayesian model averaged  predictions of individual Bayesian logistic regressions (not biased to leadrer-board).
8) finalresbiased.r - training posterior model probabilities by MJMCMC algorithm and making predictions as Bayesian model averaged  predictions of individual Bayesian logistic regressions (biased to stage 1 leadrer-board). We have increased n.models = 25000 as the tuning parameter to improve Stage 2 results. The grater n.models - the better the results since the better approximations of posterior model probabilities.
9) train.csv - train features from the pretrained MXnet.
10) test.csv - test features from the pretrained MXnet.
11) data_head.csv - features extracted from the head direction by our extractor prepare_head_logres.r
12) data_face.csv - features extracted from the face direction by our extractor prepare_face_logres.r
13) data_profile.csv - features extracted from the profile direction by our extractor prepare_profile_logres.r
14) labels known.csv - the known labels for stage 1 data
15) stage1_sample_submission_fin.csv - out best submission to test new submissions against
16) stage1_sample_submission_21.csv - our final submission without overfitting
17) stage1_sample_submission_2.csv
