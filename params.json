  "body": "Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) are addressed for inference and\r\nprediction in a wide range of different applications providing a powerful\r\nscientific tool for the researchers and analysts coming from different\r\nfields. In most of these fields more and more sources of data are becoming\r\navailable introducing a variety of hypothetical explanatory variables for\r\nthese models to be considered. Selection of an optimal combination of these\r\nvariables is thus becoming crucial in a Bayesian setting. The posterior\r\ndistribution of the models can be viewed as a relevant measure for the model\r\nevidence, based on the observed data. The number of models to select from is\r\nexponential in the number of candidate variables, moreover the search space\r\nin this context is often extremely non-concave and has numerous local\r\nextrema or statistically speaking modes. Hence efficient search algorithms\r\nhave to be adopted for evaluating the posterior distribution within a\r\nreasonable amount of time. In this paper we introduce and implement\r\nefficient mode jumping MCMC algorithms for calculating posterior\r\nprobabilities of the models for generalized linear models with a random\r\neffect. Marginal likelihoods of models, given the specific choice of priors\r\nand any choice of covariates, can be efficiently calculated using the\r\nintegrated nested Laplace approximations approach (INLA) for the class of\r\nmodels addressed, however for some particular cases exact results are also\r\navailable. We further apply the suggested algorithm to some simulated data,\r\nthe famous U.S. crime data, gene expression data, and real epigenetic data\r\nand compare its performance to some of the existing approaches like BAS, RS\r\nor MC3. \r\n\r\n* Full text of the paper is available [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06398) or [here](https://github.com/aliaksah/EMJMCMC2016/blob/master/paper/paper_full.pdf)\r\n\r\n* Short version of the paper is available [here](https://github.com/aliaksah/EMJMCMC2016/blob/master/paper/paper_short.pdf)\r\n\r\n* Proofs and pseudo-codes are available [here](https://github.com/aliaksah/EMJMCMC2016/blob/master/paper/appendix.pdf)\r\n\r\n* Latest issues of the package are available [here](https://github.com/aliaksah/EMJMCMC2016/issues)\r\n\r\n* Examples of the use of EMJMCMC described in the article are available [here](https://github.com/aliaksah/EMJMCMC2016/tree/master/examples/)  \r\n\r\n## _** Developed by [Aliaksandr Hubin](http://www.mn.uio.no/math/english/people/aca/aliaksah/) and [Geir Storvik](http://www.mn.uio.no/math/personer/vit/geirs/)**_\r\n\r\n***\r\n# To install the latest version run install.packages(\"https://github.com/aliaksah/EMJMCMC2016/files/270429/EMJMCMC_1.2.tar.gz\", repos = NULL, type=\"source\") in R.",
